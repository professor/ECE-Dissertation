Using Grounded Theory, I have examined the question, \quotes{what is happening at Pivotal when it comes to software development?} Listening to the concerns of the participants, the emergent research lead me two core concerns: how is software built and removing waste. 
 
In exploring how software is built, let to the theory of sustainable software development, a set of principles, policies, and practices used in the construction of software products. The theory is rooted in team code ownership, as removing knowledge silos and caretaking the code enable teams to be able to modify any part of the code base. 

In investigating removing waste, I created a waste taxonomy that identifies the type of waste the participants identify and try to remove in the studied organization. As a model, the waste taxonomy succinctly describes waste types and  is more descriptive than previous work. 

Here I compare this research with Extreme Programming. This research does not describe every aspect of software development at Pivotal, and thus provides motivation for additional future research.
