\section{Summary}


Using Grounded Theory, we examined the question, \quotes{what is happening at Pivotal when it comes to software development?} Listening to the concerns of the participants, the emergent research lead to three core concerns: 1) how does Pivotal construct software? 2) how does Pivotal engender team code ownership? and 3) what kinds of waste does Pivotal identify and remove in its continuous improvement? 
 
In exploring the construction of software, Grounded Theory guided us to the theory of Sustainable Software Development, a set of principles, policies, and practices used in the construction of software products so that teams survive team disruptions such as team churn. The theory is rooted in team code ownership, as removing knowledge silos and caretaking the code enable teams to be able to modify any part of the code base. 


In researching how Pivotal engenders team code ownership, we identified five factors that affect team code ownership: system context, code contribution, code quality, product fit, and team cohesion. In reviewing the data, we discovered that transitioning from individual code ownership to team code ownership is not easy for some engineers as psychological ownership fulfills deep psychological needs.


In investigating removing waste, we created a waste taxonomy that identifies the type of waste the participants detect and try to remove in the studied organization. As a model, the waste taxonomy succinctly describes waste types and is more descriptive than previous work. 


\section{Future Research}
Given the emergence of the theory of Sustainable Software Development, a model of team code ownership, and a waste taxonomy, and a deeper understanding of the evolution of Extreme Programming, there are several opportunities for future research.


For the theory of Sustainable Software Development, additional experimentation can be done to assess each practice’s flexibility
while still maintaining the ability for a team to survive disruptions. For example, Pivotal Labs adopts a shared schedule of 9 am to 6 pm. What would happen if teams adopted core hours of 10 am to 5 pm? Some engineers might work 8 am to 5 pm with soloing on simple chores for the first two hours, while other engineers might work 10 am to 7 pm with soloing on simple chores for the last two hours. In this situation, would the teams have the benefits of Sustainable Software Development while introducing one degree of freedom for flexible hours?


We are interested in the tension between individual and team ownership, as well as the factors that foster and decrease the sense of ownership. Developers, interaction designers, and product managers all have different goals for their role. Future work could examine how the sense of ownership is driven by different factors for each role. Some programmers naturally adapt to team code ownership, while others struggle with the transition. Future research could follow new Pivotal engineers and examine their journey in transitioning from individual code ownership to team code ownership. Perhaps there are specific practices that Pivotal or the development team could employ to ease the transition. We could also investigate the optimal team size for team code ownership, or explore whether Sustained Software Development works for a distributed team with a Shared Schedule.


For the waste taxonomy, Pivotal projects can systematically examine potential wastes. Some wastes are rarely salient unless one is specifically looking for them. The waste taxonomy may prove helpful in more readily identifying these waste on a project. 


Pivotal has evolved the Extreme Programming practices for building and managing a backlog. Instead of committing to work to be done each week, teams simply work off the top of the backlog in an iteration-less flow. Additional research could examine how the evolution of the Extreme Programming backlog practices affects software development.
\section{Conclusion}
Pivotal’s continuous improvement practices result in a natural evolution of Extreme Programming.  Each project becomes an experimentation opportunity for the engineers to try new ideas and see the results. As compared to a company with a relatively stable product line, Pivotal Labs has a unique opportunity for continued experimentation as it undertakes scores of projects each year. One Pivotal engineer reflected that each project feels like a hill climbing optimization algorithm exploring the feature set of the product. Each week, stories guide the product towards a delightful product for the user. Likewise, all these teams can feel like hill climbing optimization exploring the software development process. Fundamentally, the teams are on the hill of Extreme Programming. It is unlikely that the teams will accidentally discover a new hill, yet with each new project, the teams have an opportunity to refine Extreme Programming in ways not envisioned by its creator.
