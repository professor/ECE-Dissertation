\chapter{Waste Examples and Chain of Evidence}
\label{AppendixChainOfEvidence}

This section lists out the chain of evidence for the software engineering waste taxonomy. This emergent theory comes from participant observation and analysis of retrospection data. For each listed retro item, participant observation confirmed the issue. In a few instances, participant observation provided examples not identified in a retro.

% Technology that only works on one machine
% Poorly documented library
% Poorly tested library
% Dependent technology not ready for prime time
% Harmful side effects of API
% Stories missing release labels and confusion about release branches
% Working on multiple stories at once
% Working on two branches
