\section*{Acknowledgements}
I want to thank my committee members, C\'ecile P\'eraire, Paul Ralph, Martin Griss, and Jim Morris, for their guidance and expertise.

C\'ecile, you have been a wonderful advisor. Thank you for all the meetings and discussions. You have shaped me as a researcher. I continue to be impressed by your ability to structure a narrative. I am grateful that you allowed me to follow wherever the research was leading. Another advisor might have forced me to stay with a particular research question. Instead, our research and results are much more powerful and relevant to industry. 

Paul, I am thankful to have you as co-advisor, guiding me through the Byzantine ways of academia. On some days, writing code is much simpler than navigating the waters of publishing research. I appreciate your deep understanding of theory, research methods, and scholarship. I continue to be envious of your diction, but I have learned to be even more grateful for our friendship. 

Martin, I appreciate your mentoring and leadership. I coach others in the kind way that you coached me. Above all, I appreciate your strong commitment to ethical living. There were times where others would have compromised, and you surprised me by staying true to your principles.

Jim, I am grateful that you started the Silicon Valley campus of Carnegie Mellon University. I remember so many pleasant memories of working at Carnegie Mellon. When my first advisor did not want to work with a part-time student, you were there to help me through a difficult transition.

I wish to thank my family for their support of my graduate courses, research, and traveling to conferences. Without my wife Karie, this would have been impossible. Thank you Claire and Colette for welcoming me home each day by running out the front door. 

I wish to thank the leadership of Pivotal for making this research possible. Thank you to Rob Mee, David Goudreau, Ryan Richard, Zach Larson, Elisabeth Hendrickson, and Michael Schubert for making this research possible.

Thank you to Karina Sils for creating Figure \ref{PlannedDeveloperStaffing} and Figure \ref{DeveloperStaffing} using Sketch. Thanks to Ben Christel for his assistance in sorting retro topics and helping with the initial analysis for Software Engineering Waste.

\chapter{Interview Drawings and Partial Transcriptions}
\label{AppendixInterviews}
I asked many of the interviewees an open ended drawing question to begin a conversation by eliciting the their perspective on a topic. Here I include the diagrams with an abridged interview transcript where the interviewee describes their drawing.
